Yearly Ice Extent from 1979 to 2016

# Project summary
Within the framework of our [Data Visualisation](https://lyondataviz.github.io/teaching/lyon1-m2/2018/) class of Master 2 [Artificial Intelligence](http://master-info.univ-lyon1.fr/IA/) and [Data Science](http://master-info.univ-lyon1.fr/DS/), we propose you a visual display of the annual variation of the North and South polar ice cap extent. 
It contains two circular bar charts which symbolize the annual extent for each ice cap. When you select one of the bars (a year), you get two new graphics: the monthly temperature evolution and the monthly evolution of the ice extent during this year for the two poles.
